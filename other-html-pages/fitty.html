        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>
          Fitty is a mobile application designed to help users manage and plan
          their outfits efficiently. The app allows users to upload their
          wardrobe, shuffle items to generate new outfits, and lock specific
          items to avoid reshuffling. Users can save their favorite outfits for
          future reference. Additionally, Fitty features a social feed where
          users can follow others, share their outfit creations, and interact
          with the community by liking posts. The app aims to provide a seamless
          and personalized experience, focusing on user engagement and outfit
          planning across devices.

        <ul>
          <li>Frontend: Flutter and Swift</li>
          <li>
            Backend: Firebase (Firestore for database, Firebase Authentication

        <h2>Challenges</h2>
        <p>
          One of the main challenges was creating a flexible and intuitive
          outfit-shuffling mechanism. The algorithm needed to ensure that locked
          items remained in place while generating new outfit combinations based
          on color compatibility. Another challenge involved maintaining
          seamless data synchronization across devices so users could access
          their wardrobes and saved outfits from any platform without
          interruptions. Lastly, scaling the social feed to handle user
          interactions such as following, sharing, and liking outfits without
          affecting app performance required careful consideration, especially
          in terms of optimizing data queries and caching.

      <section class="project-section">
        <h2>Solutions</h2>
        <p>
          To address the challenge of outfit generation, the team developed an
          algorithm that intelligently shuffles wardrobe items based on color
          palettes. This ensures that the generated outfits are aesthetically
          coherent, providing users with practical suggestions. To tackle the
          issue of data synchronization, Firebase’s real-time capabilities were
          utilized, allowing for smooth data updates across multiple devices,
          ensuring users experience consistent interactions with their wardrobe
          and outfits. For the social feed, caching mechanisms and optimized
          Firestore queries were implemented to handle a growing number of
          users, ensuring fast load times and efficient interactions.

        <h2>Future Enhancements</h2>
        <p>
          Looking ahead, the plan is to incorporate machine learning to offer
          personalized outfit recommendations based on users’ preferences, usage
          patterns, and seasonal trends. This would elevate the app's ability to
          provide unique style suggestions tailored to each user. Additionally,
          expanding the social features is on the roadmap, with potential
          enhancements including the ability for users to comment on posts,
          participate in fashion challenges, and create groups for sharing
          outfits. Another possible future enhancement is integrating e-commerce
          functionalities, allowing users to purchase new items directly through
          the app, enhancing the wardrobe management experience.
