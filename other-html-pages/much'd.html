      <h1>Entry Wizard</h1>

      <section class="project-section">
        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>
          Entry Wizard is a Discord bot designed to automate entry submissions
          on platforms like Underdog Fantasy and PrizePicks. By precisely
          interacting with web elements, the bot significantly enhances
          operational efficiency, reducing the manual input time required from
          users. It automates over 100 daily submissions, leading to a
          substantial increase in speed and a remarkable improvement in monthly
          returns, thereby minimizing the need for manual intervention.
        </p>

        <h2>Technology Stack</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Language: Python</li>
          <li>API's: Discord API for bot interactions</li>
          <li>
            Automation Tools: Selenium for web automation, PyAutoGUI for GUI

        <h2>Challenges</h2>
        <p>
          One of the primary challenges was ensuring precise and reliable
          interactions with dynamic web elements on the target platforms.
          Webpages often change their structure or content, which can cause
          automation scripts to fail if not properly managed. Optimizing the bot
          to achieve rapid submission times without triggering any anti-bot
          mechanisms on the platforms was also a significant hurdle.
          Additionally, scaling the bot to handle over 100 daily submissions
          required robust error handling and resource management to maintain
          high performance and prevent downtime.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section class="project-section">
        <h2>Solutions</h2>
        <p>
          To address the interaction challenges, Selenium was utilized for its
          robust web automation capabilities, allowing the bot to navigate and
          interact with web elements accurately. PyAutoGUI complemented this by
          handling GUI-related tasks that required direct interaction with the
          screen. The bot's performance was optimized by streamlining the code
          and implementing asynchronous processes where possible, reducing the
          submission time to approximately 30 seconds per entryâ€”a 75% speed
          increase. Comprehensive error handling and logging were implemented to
          ensure the bot could run continuously, automating over 100 daily
          submissions with minimal manual oversight.

      <section class="project-section">
        <h2>Future Enhancements</h2>
        <p>
          Future plans for Entry Wizard include integrating advanced scheduling
          features to allow users to set specific times for submissions,
          enhancing flexibility and user control. There's also an intention to
          incorporate machine learning algorithms to predict the most favorable
          submission times or selections, potentially increasing returns
          further. Expanding compatibility with additional platforms and adding
          a user-friendly dashboard for monitoring and managing the bot's
          activities are also considered to enhance its utility and user
          experience.
